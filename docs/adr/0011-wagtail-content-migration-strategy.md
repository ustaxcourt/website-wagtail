# 11. Wagtail Content Migration Strategy

Date: 2025-04-03

## Status

Accepted

## Context

As the site maintainer, new pages will need to be created and existing pages might need to be edited.  We think having a way to copy pages from lower environments to higher environments would be helpful, so we want to look into any existing solutions.

## Decision

We decide to shelf this idea of finding a way to copy new pages from lower environments to higher environments.  We still think this concept will help with the long term development and maintainbility of the website, but for now without a working pre-made solution, the time it would take to research and implement a custom solution outweighs the benefits.

## Consequence

By postponing this idea, we can focus on other more pressing needs, but if we go to production, it may require more manual work for the maintainer to copy pages from lower environments to higher environments.
