# 2. AWS

Date: 2024-12-02

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The Tax Court is considering different cloud service providers to support its infrastructure needs. AWS (Amazon Web Services) is one of the leading options due to its wide range of services, global presence, and extensive tooling.  It is also the cloud service the court uses (along with Azure), for existing systems.  The court would like the ability to create different environments which would allow us to deploy and test our application before it goes into production.

## Decision

It was decided that using AWS would be the best option for this project.  AWS is a market leader in the industry, the Tax Court already has multiple projects setup using AWS.  Additionally, they have developers with a lot of AWS experience which would make maintaining the project easier for the internal team.  AWS offers a ton of compute primatives which allows a developer to create any type of software system needed.

## Consequences

Learning how to use AWS usually involves a large learning curve for developers, often resulting in needing an engineer who specializes in devops to keep everything running.  Deploying to AWS usually requires using IaC which yet another tool an engineer will have to write, understand, and maintain.
