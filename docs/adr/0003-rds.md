# 3. AWS RDS

Date: 2024-12-02  

## Status  

Pending  

## Context  

In order to host Wagtail, we will need a way to persist the data.  By default, Wagtail uses SQLite3, but since it is build ontop of Django, it also can be configured to Postgres.  Due to the maturity of Postgres, we decided we'd rather have a running production postgres instance that Wagtail uses as its datastore.  Since we are using AWS, RDS is one potential solution for having a managed database with little effort needed from developers to keep it updated, secure, and running.

## Decision  

We will adopt AWS RDS as our primary relational database solution. AWS RDS supports multiple database engines, such as PostgreSQL, MySQL, and Aurora, providing flexibility to choose the best-fit technology for different applications. Its managed services, including automated backups, patches, and scaling, allow the team to focus on application development rather than database administration. Additionally, features like Multi-AZ deployments and read replicas align with the need for high availability and improved read performance.

SQLite includes it's own bucket of caverates, such as where will the .sqlite file live?  the running service needs a non-ephemerial volume mount for updating the files.  Also, how would we easily modify the database if it's only on a file.  Additionally, how well can sqlite handle if we are running backups while the system is currently running.  SQLite came away with more questions that made Postgres seem like a simplier solution.

## Consequences  

Using RDS often requires setting up a VPC to keep the database only accessible from internal service.  Additionally, this security constraint often requires a more complex deployment process such as using a bastion host to tunnel through when needing to apply migration scripts to the database.  A VPC often brings a lot of additional complexity via infrastructure as code to wire everything together, and to allow our services to access the internet via gateways.
