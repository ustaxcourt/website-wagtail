# 6. GitHub Actions  

Date: 2024-12-02  

## Status  

Pending  

## Context 

We'll need a way to run automated scripts for testing and deployments.  There are tons of CI/CD solutions, including Jenkins, CircleCI, TravisCI, Github Actions.


## Decision  

We decided to use Github Actions for many reasons.  One, the Tax Court developers already have a lot of experience using github actions.  Second, github actions are free to use for open source project, which I believe this website will be.  Third, github actions is a widely used and known tool for running continious integration pipelines, including a lot of community actions we can utilize.

## Consequences
