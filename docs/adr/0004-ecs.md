# 4. AWS ECS Fargate  

Date: 2024-12-02  

## Status  

Pending  

## Context  

In order to deploy the Wagtail service, we either need to create our own orchestration services for provisioning EC2 instances, setting up our wagtail project, running it, updating it, etc.  There are many managed services on AWS, one including ECS Fargate which basically auto scales your containerized service automatically.

## Decision  

We choose to use Fargate because it will automatically scale up containers as needed, meaning we as developer would not need to worry much about scale.  Additionally, ECS has built in methods for doing rolling releases, meaning we'd accure no downtime when deploying new versions of our containers.  ECS will spin up a new container, gracefully transition traffic to the new container, and tear down the old container when no more traffic hits the old container.  ECS is also relatively cheap and easier to hit the ground running compared to provisning an EC2 instance by hand and finding ways to automate the deployments.

## Consequences  

ECS Fargate can have a learning curve to understanding it.
